To add a Redis instance:

1. Go to the RedisInsight interface: http://localhost:5540
2. Click on "Add Redis Database." 
3. For "Hostname," use the name of the Redis service (since RedisInsight is on the same network container as Redis). 
4. In "Port," enter 6379. 
5. In "Password," enter the password secret.
